		"content": "Text:  Ruth 1:1-5\n\nSermon Title:  \"I'm in a Mess in Moab\"\n\n\"When Benjamin Franklin was United States Ambassador to France, he occasionally attended the Infidels Club---a group that spent most of its time searching for and reading literary masterpieces. On one occasion Franklin read the book of Ruth to the club when it was gathered together, but changed the names in it so it would not be recognized as a book of the Bible. When he finished, they were unanimous in their praise. They said it was one of the most beautiful short stories that they had ever heard, and demanded that he tell them where he had run across such a remarkable literary masterpiece. It was his great delight to tell them that it was from the Bible, which they professed to regard with scorn and derision, and in which they felt there was nothing good.”  ***Ray Stedman, Ruth: The Romance of Redemption***\n\n# 1. The Context of the Story\nIn the canon of Scripture, Ruth follows the book of Judges.  However, the events recorded for us in this short story are set during a period in Israel’s history when the Judges ruled.  The Book of Ruth shines as a diamond against the black cloth of the time period recorded in the book of Judges.  \n## A. It was a Time When Direction was Not Clear\nThe time period recorded in the book of Judges is summed up by a phrase which is a recurring one throughout the book of Judges.\n\n**“In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.”** *Judges 17:6, 18:1, 19:1, 21:25*\n\n[Pastor Terry Trivette](http://standandspeak.org) of [Sharon Heights Baptist Church](http://www.sharonheights.org) stated when preaching through the Book of Judges, \"This book constantly points us to our need of a King.\"  Without a king, it was utter confusion and chaos.  The characters that rose up to judge Israel did so under the leadership of God and were used mightily of the Lord, but were also deeply flawed and constantly point us to our need of a Leader who is not flawed.  Ultimately, we find such a King not in David, but in the Son of David.  Not in Solomon, but in Jesus.     \n## B. It was a Time When Defection was Convenient\nThe book of Judges is really a book of sinful cycles.  From the time that God brought His people into the land of promise, they would quickly run after the gods of the peoples of that land (even though they were commanded to utterly drive them out of the land.)  This would lead to God raising up an enemy nation to smite the children of Israel.  After years of oppression and by reason of Israel's cries for deliverance, God would raise up a military/political/spiritual figure, known as a Judge, to deliver the people.  Deliverance would be wrought, vicotry would be realized, the people would once again enjoy liberty, and then the cycle would begin again.  Judges 2 describes these sinful cycles.\n\nOne of the curses that God promised he would bring upon Israel for their disobedience in the land of promise (Deut. 28:15) would be that He would cause the heaven over their head to be brass, and the earth under their feet to be iron (Deut. 28:23).  Deuteronomy 11:13-17 spells this out even mre clearly.  He would cause the environmental conditions to be such that their crops would not yield.  The book of Ruth seemingly opens up in the midst of a sinful cycle in which God has sent a famine and the inhabitants of the Bethlehemjudah are in hunger.  The easier option would seem to be defection, to leave the land of promise because, at that time, it certainly wasn't the land of provision.\n\nThrough all of the sinfulness and darkness that is the time period known as the Judges, the Book of Ruth emerges as a faithful reminder that even in the darkest of times, God is still working out His redemptive purposes, all to the praise of the glory of His grace! \n# 2. The Characters of the Story \nChapter 1 introduces us to the majority of the characters that will comprise this story.  It is a family of four who are noted to be \"Ephrathites\", or descendants of Ephraim.  \n## A. What We Learn from their Names\nThe patriarch of the family is named ***Elimelech***.  His name means \"***My God is King***.\"  He is married to ***Naomi***, whose name means \"***my delight***\" or, as some would suggest, \"***pleasant***\".  Their two sons, ***Mahlon*** and ***Chilion*** also have very interesting names.  Their names mean ***sick*** and ***pining***, respectively.   \n\nSo, what do we learn from these names?  We learn of a man who is making decisions contrary to his name, his heritage and that put his already fragile family in serious trouble.  For instance, Elimelech's name would suggest a rich and goodly heritage, one filled wiht the knowledge of God.  Yet, in choosing to defect to Moab even in a difficult time, he is denying the kingship of His God over his life.  As Dr. Alan Carr of [The Sermon Notebook](http://sermonnotebook.org)  put it, ***\"His name means \"My God Is King.\" If that had been true about this man, he would have known that God's valleys do not last forever and that God would have taken care of His people.\"***\n\nFurthermore, who else could take such delight in Naomi?  Who else could be so pleased with her other than Elimelech?  Does he not consider the effects of the decision to move to Moab will be on his delightful wife?  And, what of Mahlon and Chilion?  Their names suggest that they are not in the greatest of health.  Wouldn't such a drastic and distant move, across treacherous terrain, be detrimental to their already pitiful conditions?  \n## B. What We Learn from their Nativity \nElimelech and his family are inhabitants of a city named Bethlehemjudah.  Again, by discovering the meaning of the names provided for us, we can glean all the much more from this story.  Breaking the name of town of their nativity into two parts, we first learn that \"***Bethlehem***\" means ***\"the house of bread***.\"  Secondly, the name \"***Judah***\" means \"***praise***.\"\n\nGranted, things aren't too pretty in the \"***house of bread and praise***\" at the moment, but we'd love to stop Elimelech before he leaves and ask him should God be pleased to once again visit His people and provide bread for them, is there a more likely place for Him to do it than at the \"***house of bread and praise***\"?  We know, from reading the rest of the Bible, that Bethlehemjudah is named so not necessarily for its abundance of physical crop, but for the fact that from this small town, the \"***true bread from heaven*** (John 6:32) would come down from heaven so that whosoever would eat of this bread could live eternally (John 6:50, 51).\n# 3. The Choice of the Story \n\nProvidence is a big theme in the Book of Ruth.  [James Montgomery Boice](http://www.the-highway.com/providence_Boice.html), quoting (in part) the Westminster Confession of Faith V.i, defines Providence as ***God has not abandoned the world that he created, but rather works within that creation to manage all things according to the “immutable counsel of His own will.\"***  Boice also stressed that this doctrine of *Divine Providence* is one that, more than any other Christian doctrine, cuts across the grain of the common worldview that demands to be lords of their own destinies.  It evens causes many sincere believers to pause and consider its vast and deep implications.  \n\nI don't have all the answers when it comes to God's providence, and His governance over the affairs of men.  What part does our will play?  Are the events of our lives pre-planned?  Are we merely pawns acting out our parts at the disposal of another?  When thinking on these matters, Proverbs 16:9 has brought great comfort and clarity to me.  \"***A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.***\"We make our choices, we make our plans and do so according to our will.  Providence, however, teaches us that as we choose as we will, God works through it all to perform His will in our lives and in this world.\n\nRuth teaches us that God works through the good choices, and the bad choices.  Elimelech was not a puppet on the string who uncontrollably one day decided to leave the *Promised Land* for the place that God calls His *Wash Pot*. This was a very bad choice that Elimelech made that would bring him and his family much pain, but God continues to work through this choice to bring about His purpose and plan.  Why was the choice Elimelech made such a bad choice?\n## A. The Bad Choice to Leave for Moab\n**Ch 1:1 - \"went to sojourn in the country of Moab\"**\n### 1. It’s a Choice to Backtrack\n“To do so, he had to hike through the desolate Jericho pass, through the Judean wilderness near the Dead Sea, going across the Jordan River, into the land of Moab. This was a definite departure from the Promised Land of Israel, and a return towards the wilderness from which God had delivered Israel hundreds of years before. These were clearly steps in the wrong direction.” ***David Guzik, Study Guide for Ruth 1***\n\nThe purpose and plan of God never is hindered, never is thwarted and never regresses.  How sad, conversely, when we disobey and sin against God, we fail to realize that such actions cause us to temporarily backtrack.  Our sanctification is progressive, in which we should be progressing.  When we sin and do not immediately repent, we regress.  Sin is degenerative.  The longer we stay in that sin, the more damage is done.  \n### 2. It’s a Choice that is Baffling\nOf all the places that Elimelech could've went, he chose to sojourn in the land of Moab.  Moab was certainly no friend of the nation of Israel at this time, nor had it ever been.  The nation arose from an incestous relationship that took place between Lot and one of his daughters in the infamous series of events that transpired after he was delivered from Sodom and Gomorah (Genesis 19:30-38).  The descendents from this despicable act violent, vile, idolatrous people.  During Israel's wilderness wanderings, the Moabites attacked Israel violently, seeking to destroy them (Num. 23-25; Deut. 23:3-6).  God despised this nation, calling them his ***washpot*** in Psalm 60:8.  The washpot to which God is referring is the vessel of unclean water used by slaves to wash the feet of a conquering foe.  \n\nBless the Lord that in spite of this nation being the enemies of the people of God and of God Himself, He is pleased to call Ruth from this enemy nation and save her by His grace and place her in the lineage of the Lord Jesus Christ (not to skip ahead in the story - but anyone knowledgable of this story can't help it at times).   But, then again, \"***when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son***\" (Romans 5:10).  \n\nHaving no knowledge of this, Elimelech still chose to defect to a nation that were bitter enemies of his homeland and of his Lord, and this choice baffles us.  Just as baffling is when we choose to sin against a Holy, Gracious, Loving Lord.  \n## B. The Bad Choice to Live in Moab \n**Ch 1:2 - And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.**\n\nAs if it wasn't a bad enough choice to leave for Moab, Elimelech and his family made an even graver mistake in continuing in Moab.  The story tells us that they departed Bethlehemjudh for to ***sojourn*** in the land of Moab, verse 1.  However, verse 2 tells us the family ***continued*** in Moab.  Verse 4 states \"***they dwelled there about ten years.***\"  They dwelled there so long that the disobedience of the father was bred into his sons.  \"***They took them wives of the women of Moab.***\"  Obviously, Elimelech had failed in teaching his children the truths of Scripture.  If he had, he would have covered ***Numbers 25*** and would have instructed them in the consequences of taking wifes of the women of Moab.\n# 4. The Consequences of the Story\nAs the old adage goes, \"Sin will take you further than you want to go, keep you longer than you want to stay, and cost you far more than you are willing to pay.  In Romans 6:23, the Apostle Paul says, \"***For the wages of sin is death.***\"  \n\n## A. The Death of a Spouse\n**Ch1:3 - And Elimelech Naomi's husband died**\n## B. The Death of Sons\n**Ch 1:5 - And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them**\n\nIn conclusion, may the dire consequences Elimelech suffered, and those whom he undoubtedly loved dearly, serve as a warning to those who would sin after his similitude.  Romans 15:4, \"***For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.***\"  Because of Elimelech's sinful choices, Naomi finds herself ***in a mess in Moab***. Verse 5 says, \"***the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.***\"  You might be a Naomi who is suffering from the sinful choices of an Elimelech.  May the furtherance of this series of sermons serve to encourage you that God is at work in the midst of your mess, and will indeed work a miracle from your mess.\n\n\n----------\n\nPastor Chris Kitchens\nCorinth Baptist Church\nAlbertville, AL\nChris Kitchens",
