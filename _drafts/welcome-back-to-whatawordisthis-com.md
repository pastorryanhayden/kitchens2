Though we did not allow the domain name to expire, [our ministry website](whatawordisthis.com) has been lying dormant for some time now and, frankly, I am coming to grips with the fact that I have vastly underutilized this great medium. Let me give you a brief history of this website.

It all started in 2008 when my wife and I purchased our first home computer. Up until then, we both had been using an antiquated Sony Vaio that I had brought into the marriage. We pinched our pennies and decided to go with an iMac. At the time, just two years into our marriage, it was a major financial decision, but we decided to invest in our money in a home computer that we could trust and use for years to come. We are still using this computer to this day, and it has been a wonderful tool for many purposes.![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/vZ8wp1i.jpg)

Once we set up the new computer, I quickly discovered a program called "iWeb". As I begin to look through this program, I started having fun with it and designing a website for our preaching ministry. What started as a little fun with a new computer program led to a fully designed website. My primary intention for the website was not to promote the ministry, but to provide resources to others that had encouraged me. I then had to seek for a domain name. At the time, I was teaching a series on the transmission of scripture and why the Authorized Version (King James Bible) is to be preferred over all other English translations. This series was entitled, "What A Word Is This!" taken from Luke 4:36. Amazingly, the domain "[whatawordisthis.com](http://whatawordisthis.com)" was available. I have owned it since then. I posted sermons, photos, blog-like posts, etc...on a regular basis and it seemed to be a blessing to a limited audience.

Unfortunately, the iWeb service ceased at some point and the site lay dormant for some time. I attempted to resurrect the site in the summer of 2014 with a fresh design by [Pastor Ryan Hayden](http://pastorryanhayden.com)`. Pastor Hayden did a wonderful job designing the site; I didn't do such a great job completing the info that Pastor Hayden needed and updating contect regularly. Additionally, something else kind of wonderful happened toward the end of that year. I was called to pastor the Corinth Missionary Baptist Church in Moulton, AL. This confluence of several different events created a perfect storm in which web design/maintenance was the last thing on which I could focus my attention.

So, what are we doing now? Well, I have once again engaged Pastor Hayden to relaunch the site, this time as a part of the [sitesfor.church](http://sitesfor.church) project, to reflect the current status of my preaching ministry as the Pastor of Corinth. I hope to start posting sermon audio (though we have a lot of work to do at Corinth in order to increase the quality of our audio recordings) very soon. I am also going to try my hand at blogging occasionally, posting sermon notes from different preaching series, etc. Who knows where this might go!

The intent remains the same as the first site that I designed with iWeb, I remember posting on that site that the intent was to "***Exalt the Saviour, Encourage the Saint and Evanglize the Sinner!***" May God bless this effort to the end that His name may be made known in all the earth. Your feedback is welcomed, and appreciated.
